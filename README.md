# Resource Explorer - Pokémon Edition

A high-performance React application for exploring Pokémon data with advanced search, filtering, and favorites management.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Features
- **Paginated List View**: Infinite scroll with virtualization for smooth performance
- **Detail View**: Rich Pokémon details with stats, abilities, and characteristics
- **Search**: Real-time search with debouncing and request cancellation
- **Filtering**: Filter by type, generation, and favorites
- **Sorting**: Sort by ID, name, height, or weight
- **Favorites**: Persistent favorites with localStorage
- **URL State Management**: Shareable URLs that preserve search/filter/sort state
- **Personal Notes**: Add and manage notes for each Pokémon with form validation
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright tests for critical user flows

### Technical Excellence
- **Performance Optimized**: 
  - React Query for intelligent caching and background refetching
  - Code splitting with lazy loading
  - Virtualized lists for large datasets (100+ items)
  - Web Vitals monitoring
  - Optimistic UI updates
  - Request batching for efficient API calls
- **Accessibility**: 
  - Semantic HTML
  - ARIA labels and descriptions
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Focus management
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Error boundaries
  - Graceful degradation
  - Retry mechanisms
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode with system preference detection

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🎯 Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- **URL as Source of Truth**: Search params, filters, and pagination state are stored in the URL for shareability
- **React Query**: Handles server state with intelligent caching and background updates
- **Local State**: UI state managed with React hooks
- **Persistent Storage**: Favorites and theme preferences stored in localStorage

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Code Splitting**: Routes are lazy loaded to reduce initial bundle size
2. **Data Fetching**: 
   - Parallel queries for Pokemon details
   - Request deduplication
   - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
3. **UI Optimizations**:
   - Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Debounced search input
   - Skeleton loading states
   - Optimistic updates for favorites

### Error Handling Strategy
- API errors are caught and transformed into user-friendly messages
- Network failures trigger automatic retries
- Error boundaries prevent app crashes
- Empty states guide users when no data is available

## 🔄 Trade-offs Made

1. **Client-side Search**: The PokeAPI doesn't support server-side search, so we fetch and filter client-side. In production, this would be handled server-side for better performance.

2. **Virtualization Toggle**: Implemented react-window virtualization as an optional feature (toggles on when 100+ items). This gives users choice between familiar grid layout and performance-optimized list.

3. **Type Safety**: Some API response types are simplified. In a production app, we'd use code generation from OpenAPI specs.

4. **E2E Test Coverage**: Implemented basic smoke tests covering core flows. More comprehensive tests would be added in a production environment.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

If given more time, I would implement:

1. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Advanced filters (multiple types, stats ranges)
   - Comparison mode for multiple Pokémon
   - Export favorites to CSV/JSON
   - PWA capabilities for offline access

2. **Performance**:
   - Service Worker for offline caching
   - Image optimization with responsive loading
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Server-side rendering with Next.js

3. **Testing**:
   - Expand E2E test coverage
   - Unit tests for utilities and hooks
   - Visual regression testing
   - Performance testing

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - Storybook for component documentation
   - Husky for pre-commit hooks
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The app monitors Core Web Vitals:
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint): < 1.8s
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1
- **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint): < 200ms
- **TTFB** (Time to First Byte): < 800ms
